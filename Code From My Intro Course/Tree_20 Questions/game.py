"""
This is a 20 questions game. It actually has like 3 questions but the more you
play, the more questions are built. SO, you could have a huge number of questions
if you played for a long time. One caveat though, it's only about animals. 

   
# a few examples (I compressed the space a bit)

    #EX 1:
#==================================================

Let's play 20 questions (ish). Think of an animal.

Is it a mammal?
Give your response as a single letter y or n: y
Does it have 4 legs?
Give your response as a single letter y or n: n


I guess: human
Was I right?
Again give a y or n: n
What yes/no question has a yes answer that would let me distinguish your animal from my guess?
Write it here: Does it lay eggs?
What was your animal?
Write it here: Platupus

Do you want to keep playing?
Give a y for yes or anything else for no: y

Ha ha! WHOOOP! I WON! YOU LOST! IN YOUR FACE!

Do you want to keep playing?
Give a y for yes or anything else for no: n
