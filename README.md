#My Online Workspace
This is my repository for all personal projects and general coding done online.
If you want more of me (my blog, my resume, general stuff about me), you can see my [website](http://divesh-otwani.github.io/My-Online-Workspace/) which is hosted on the gh-pages branch of this repository.
If I want to work on a very large project, I'll make a separate repository.
Most of my coding is in C and Python so those folders are the most populated.
I have a bit of C++ and Haskell.

##Organization
I divide it by work done in each language and you will find documentation in there.


##About Me
I am currently a Sophomore at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/
"Haverford College"). I am on track to be a computer science major.

I've been to a few Hackathons and plan on going on many, many more. I am
experienced with Python and C, comfortable with C++ and familiar with Haskell, Java and 
JavaScript.

##Other Work
I put large projects (which often start at Hackathons and are carried on) in
seperate repositories. See
[here](https://github.com/Divesh-Otwani/Waitlist_Exchange "College Waitlists are
terrible, aren't they?") for a good example.
