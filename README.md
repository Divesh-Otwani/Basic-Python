# Basic-Python
This is my repository for projects in python. 

In here I include:

1. Work done in my introduction to computer science and data structures class

2. Some simple programs and games like Checkers

3. Random scripts (ranging from easy projects to very hard, perhaps unfinished ones)  I wrote because of something that peaked my interest.

3. A few select finished projects that required significant work.
