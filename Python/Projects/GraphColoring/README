In this directory I give many approaches in solving 
the graph coloring problem: 

Given some bidirectional simple graph and a finite set of distict colors, 
find a mapping of each node to some color in the set 
such that no two nodes that share an edge have the same color, or, 
report that no such coloring exists.
