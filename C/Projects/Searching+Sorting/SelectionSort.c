/*
In this file, I implement a generic selection sort
which takes in
	1) An array
	2) The size of the array (number of elements)
	3) The size of each element of the array
	4) A function that takes in two pointers to elements of the array, p1, p2
		and returns 1 iff (*p1) <= (*p2)
		and -1 otherwise
	and sorts the array in ascending order
