# Haskell Projects

## Current Work


- SixTheGame 
  - This is a really elegant, but powerful mathematical game
  - I'm a few hours away from finishing the core engine. 
    - I put some time into making the data types elegant and the code readable.
- Brainf
  - This is a simplified interpreter for the language [brainf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
  - There is one part left to add: while loops. The only hard part in 
    implementing them is parsing the abstract syntax tree.
- Untyped lambda calculus
  - This is a bit of a mess. 
    I think I didn't implement the onestepEval well.
    Perhaps, I should have used de-brujn indicies like everyone else does.
    This is a big todo.
