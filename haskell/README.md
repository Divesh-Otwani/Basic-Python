# Haskell


Haskell is my favorite programming language.

* The syntax is elegant and majestic
* The ability to make types is phenomenal
* A static type system + pureness enables you to make things elegant, correct and modular.

See the projects folder for the few projects I have right now.
Inside each actual project directory, there is a readme for that project.
The main project I have now is a core engine for the game six.

I plan on making a lot more projects.

## Here are some of my project ideas for later:

 * I want a decsion tree visualizer for course scheduling. That is, I want to be able to list a bunch of classes I'm interested in and see what choices I have once I choose a few classes. This invaluable when scheduling classes. Right now, I need to make decision trees manually and check manually whether two classes conflict. I need to draw schedules manually to see what my week would feel like.
 * I want a word processor that has vim navigation and can be customized.
 * I have a scala project called waitlist exchange that would be better in Haskell.



### Enormous Project Ideas

 * I want a kernel that has 'diffs' for your operating system and can push changes to the cloud
   * This way, if your hardware is compromised, the entire state of your machine in the last push is saved online.
