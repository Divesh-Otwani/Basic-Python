# Notes/Code

 • Let expressions are real expressions, evaluated the first then second
 • .ml files are sequence of declarations
    ◦ some of these are type declarations, some are let declarations
    ◦ other declaration types too
 • Lexically scoped: variables are always to closest definition
 • Evaluation of “let x = e1 in e2”
    ◦ evaluate e1 to v1
    ◦ substitute in e2 to e2’
    ◦ evaluate e2’ to v2
