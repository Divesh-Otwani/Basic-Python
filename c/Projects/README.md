Most of my files have documentation in comments at the top.
That said, here are the notable things:

* BrainF_Repl is a REPL for the simple turing complete programming language [BrainF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
* ConwayGameOfLife is the cellular automaton devised by mathmatician John Horton Conway. Read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
* Searching+Sorting has some traditional searching and sorting algorithms such as binary search and merge sort.
