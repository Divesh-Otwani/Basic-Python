# Six

I implement the game "Six".
See [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20195/six) for a desciption.

Right now, I'm doing it with some GUI stuff but I think I'll switch to 
doing it with yesod and running it online.

## Status

The core engine is almost done.

I haven't started on the GUI.
I've decided I'm going to push it to the web and implement the gui using yesod.
