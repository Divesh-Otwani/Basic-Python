To play the game, simply run the file game.py
Then, think of an animal and answer each question
honestly with a y for yes or n for no. Do not put ''
around your responses. Just type the letters.

At the end of a game, if the computer lost, you will be asked to 
give a yes or no question that has a 'yes' answer for your animal but a no 
for the animal the computer guessed. Then, you will be asked to input your animal.

Then, you will be asked if you want to keep playing. If you say yes, 
you will now play the game with your new animal added as a possible guess. Otherwise, the game will
end and you will need to type play4eva() in the kernel in order to play again.
Note: if you exit and play again any new animals you added in the previous game will
be erased.

(Also, if the computed had guessed your animal, you would still
be asked if you wanted to keep playing.)

Enjoy!
