# Online Workspace
This is my repository for all coding saved online. 

I divide it by work done in each language and one folder that serves as a portfolio for all my significat work.

Within each folder for a programming language, I include:

1. Random scripts (ranging from easy projects to very hard, perhaps unfinished ones)  I wrote because of something that peaked my interest.

2. Work done for or related to some classes
