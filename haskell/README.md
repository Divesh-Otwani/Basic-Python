# Haskell


Haskell is an awesome programming language.

* The syntax is elegant and majestic
* The ability to make types is phenomenal
* A static type system + pureness enables you to make things elegant, correct and modular.

See the projects folder for the few projects I have right now.


## Project Ideas:

 * A decision tree visualizer for course scheduling. I want to be able to list
   a bunch of classes I'm interested in and see what choices I have once I
   choose a few classes. This is invaluable when scheduling classes. Right now, I
   need to make decision trees manually and check manually whether two classes
   conflict. I need to draw schedules manually to see what my week would feel
   like.
 * A word processor with vim navigation
 * An automatic trading setup thing.
