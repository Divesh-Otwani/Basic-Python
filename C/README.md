# C Programming

My C programming is broken up into the following categories.

* Basic_Stuff is a few simple problems. 
* Data_Structures contains the following implemented in full generality. That is, they work with generic pointers to support all data units. 
  * A binary search tree
  * A hash table
  * A heap
  * A linked list
  * A double linked list
  * A queue and a stack
* Foundations_For_Cpp is some exercises from a resource I used to learn C
* Projects is large apps. My documentation can be found within that directory.
