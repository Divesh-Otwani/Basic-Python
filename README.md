#My Online Workspace
This is my repository for all personal projects and general coding done online.
If I want to work on a very large project, I'll make a sepeate repository.

##Organization
I divide it by work done in each language and one folder that has a link to my
*Favorite Work* regardless of language (has a few symlinks you'll need to follow).

The rest is self-explanatory.

##About Me
I am currently a Sophmore at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/
"Haverford College"). I am considering being computer science major.

I've been to a few hackathons and plan on going on many, many more. I am
familiar with Python and C and am currently learning C++, Clojure and Scheme.


##Other Work
I put large projects (which often start at Hackathons and are carried on) in
seperate repositories. See
[here](https://github.com/Divesh-Otwani/Waitlist_Exchange "College Waitlists are
terrible, aren't they?") for a good example.
