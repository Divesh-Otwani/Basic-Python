# Python Work



The folder names are pretty self explanatory. I describe the significant folders:

* Major applications are in Projects/. There is documentation in there.
* Data structures has a few traditional data structures: stack, queue, heap, binary tree
* CryptologySeminarCode has a few factoring algorithms and a full example of encryption and decryption via RSA. It also has the code to help one easily set up RSA for them self (provided you know what you are doing and choose your modulus, exponent and primes correctly)
* FavoriteWorkFromCS107 has the most advanced stuff I did in my intro cs course. It has:
  * Checkers on the terminal
  * An implementation of a 20 questions game
  * A solution to a graph coloring problem
* OnlineMITCourse is all the work from my first CS course
  * This is available on the website [Edx](https://www.edx.org/)
