# Python

The folder names are pretty self explanatory. I describe the significant folders:

* Major applications are in projects/. There is documentation in there.
* data-structures has a few traditional data structures: stack, queue, heap,
  binary tree
* cryptology-seminar has a few factoring algorithms and a full example of
  encryption and decryption via RSA. It also has the code to help one easily
  set up RSA for them self (provided you know what you are doing and choose
  your modulus, exponent and primes correctly)
* intro-cs-work has the most advanced stuff I did in my intro cs course. It has:
  * Checkers on the terminal
  * An implementation of a 20 questions game
  * A solution to a graph coloring problem
* edx-introcs-mit-course is all the work from an online intro cs course I took
  * This is available on the website [Edx](https://www.edx.org/)
