1)

The code will not work. The type of maxlen is int while the type of s.name.size() 
is std::string::size_type. Further, maxlen is not initalized. While strings have an 
initial "" value, ints do not. 

You would fix it by changing the first line to 
	std::string::size_type maxlen;
	maxlen = 0; // not sure if this initialization is needed

3) I can't prove it but setw is malfunctioning on me.

7) done

8)

You can infer it returns a collection of doubles that can be indexed.
It could be a vector<double>.
