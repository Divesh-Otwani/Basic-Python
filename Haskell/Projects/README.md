# Haskell Projects

## Current Work

I have two main projects which are in progress.

- SixTheGame 
  - This is a really elegant, but powerful mathematical game
  - I'm a few hours away from finishing the core engine. 
    - I put some time into making the data types elegant and the code readable.
- Untyped lambda calculus
  - This is a bit of a mess. 
    I think I didn't implement the onestepEval well.
    Perhaps, I should have used de-brujn indicies like everyone else does.
    This is a big todo.
   

## Intro Haskell Final Project
   
I also have my final project from my intoductory haskell course.
