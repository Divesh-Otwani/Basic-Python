# Scala

I like scala. It has some good ideas. It just needs a solid theoretical foundatation.

## Directories

* CrashCourse is a crash course in scala I did. Its the bare minimum to get up to speed.
* Projects has my one project:
  * Waitlist Exchange is a project about allowing safe concurrent class trading. The project dir has a detailed readme.
