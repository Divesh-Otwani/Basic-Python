# Haskell Projects

## Current Work

My largest haskell project is my research project: a plugin for GHC.
See [here](https://github.com/Divesh-Otwani/popl-src-2018-type-level-finite-maps).

I haven't had time to flush out any large personal haskell projects.
I hope to during my breaks in the school year.


- SixTheGame 
  - This is a really elegant, but powerful mathematical game
  - I'm a few hours away from finishing the core engine. 
    - I put some time into making the data types elegant and the code readable.
- Brainf
  - This is a simplified interpreter for the language [brainf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
  - There is one part left to add: while loops. The only hard part in 
    implementing them is parsing the abstract syntax tree.
  

## Intro Haskell Final Project
   
I also have my final project from my intoductory haskell course.
