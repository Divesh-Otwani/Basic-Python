# Haskell Projects

## Current Work

My largest haskell project is my research project: a plugin for GHC called
[thoralf](https://github.com/bgamari/the-thoralf-plugin).


I haven't had time to flush out any large personal haskell projects.


- six-the-game
  - This is a really elegant, but powerful mathematical game
- brainf
  - This is a simplified interpreter for the language [brainf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)


## Intro Haskell Final Project

See [here](https://github.com/Divesh-Otwani/HaskellFinalProj) for my final
project from my introductory Haskell course.
