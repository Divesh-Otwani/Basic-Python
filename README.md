# My Online Workspace

This is my repository for all personal projects and general coding done online.
Most of my coding is in C and Python so those folders are the most populated.


## Organization

I break it down into work done in each language and from there I've got
documentation in each folder.



## A Little About Me
I'm a Math  & CS major at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/
"Haverford College").

I am well-versed in Haskell, Scala, C and Python. I'm familiar or have heard of the
other languages listed here.
