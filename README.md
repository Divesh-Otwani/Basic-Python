# Python
This is my repository for projects in python. 

In here I include:

1. Random scripts (ranging from easy projects to very hard, perhaps unfinished ones)  I wrote because of something that peaked my interest.

2. Work done for or related to some classes

3. Some simple programs and games like Checkers

4. A few select finished projects (my portfolio) that required significant work.
