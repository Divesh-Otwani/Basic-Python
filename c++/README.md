# C++ Coding

I don't have many C++ projects yet. I just played with C++ since it is popular and influential.
Folders:

* AcceleratedCpp is the solutions to a great C++ textbook by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E Moo. I have notes and some exercises in that directory.
* [ICPC](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1) and [UVaOnlineJudge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1) are competitive programming practice websites. I did one problem from each just to explore.
