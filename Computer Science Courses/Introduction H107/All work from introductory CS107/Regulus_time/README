Time_represented_by_seconds or Time_represented_by_clock_and_calendar
are short classes that store time up to the detail of seconds for
the planet regulus

Each have the following properties:
1. You input the seconds since the discovery of regulus to 
intialize a time object:
time1 = Time(34634)

2. You add (or subtract with adding negative) minutes to a time object
using 'add_minutes'
Ex:
time1.addminutes(30)

This ^ adds 30 minutes to the 'time1' object

3. You can see the change from time1 to time2 using
'minutes_until' 
Note: this change can be negative

Ex:
time1.minutes_until(time2)

This ^ gives the number of minutes that are added (including adding negative minutes)
to time1 to get to time2. This is rounded down to the nearest integer.

4. Time is displayed as "mm/dd/yy hrs:mins:secs RST" (RST could be RDT, which is
time during daylight savings hours
from 2am april first to 3am cotober first)
