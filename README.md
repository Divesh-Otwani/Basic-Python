# My Online Workspace
This is my repository for all personal projects and general coding done online.
If you want more of me (my blog, my resume, general stuff about me), you can see my [website](http://divesh-otwani.github.io/My-Online-Workspace/) which is hosted on the gh-pages branch of this repository.

Most of my coding is in C and Python so those folders are the most populated.

## Organization
I divide it by work done in each language and you will find documentation in each folder.


## About Me
I am currently a Junior at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/
"Haverford College"). I am a mathematics and computer science double major.

I am well-versed in Haskell, Scala, C and Python. I'm familiar or have heard of the
other languages listed here.

Languages I want to learn: Agda, Rust.
