Checkers_Game Readme

Three instructions:

1. If you want to play with a friend, run the module and then 
run
>>> game()

2. If you want to play a stored game, then store a game as a list
like this:
a = [
[(2,1), (3,2)],
[(5,0), (4,1)],
[(3,2), (5,0)],
[(5,6), (4,7)],
[(1,2), (2,1)],
[(6,5), (5,6)],
[(0,1), (1,2)],
[5,6,4,5],
[(5,6), (4,5)],
[(2,5), (3,4)],
[(6,7), (5,6)],
[(2,1), (3,0)],
[(5,4), (4,3)],
[(1,2), (2,1)],
[(7,6), (6,5)],
[(4,3), (2,5)],
[(1,4), (3,6)],
[(3,6), (5,4)], 
[(6,3),(4,5)], 
[(0,3), (1,2)],
[(7,2), (6,3)],
[(5,0), (7,2)],
[(7,2), (5,4)],
[(5,4), (3,6)], 
[(4,7), (2, 5)],
[(1,6),(3,4)],
[(5,2), (4,3)],
[(3,4), (5,2)],
[(7,4), (6,3)],
[(5,2), (7,4)],
[(7,0), (6,1)],
[(7,4), (6,3)],
[(6,1), (5,2)],
[(6,3), (5,4)],
[(6,3), (4, 1)],
[(7,6), (6,5)],
[(2,3), (3,4)],
[(6,5), (5,4)],
[(1,2), (2,3)],
[(5,6), (4,5)],
[(3,4), (5, 6)],
[(5,4), (4,3)],
[(4,1), (3,2)],
[(4,3), (3,4)],
[(2,3), (4,5)]
]

and run
>>> game(a)


3. If you want to play my relatively dumb ai, 
run

>>> game_ai()


That's all. Enjoy!
