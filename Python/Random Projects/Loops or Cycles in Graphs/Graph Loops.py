fix:
the test says wrong when right

and the eq for loop on=bjects might be failing

ALGORITHM N^2 FOR Connected

    just cahnge it to instead of deleting, chekcing if going to the next
    node would be a loop that is already done and stored in dict of set
    of loop objects

Overall:
    would need backend to first oraganize the pairs into
    say, m, dispareante graphs in O(n^2) for n pairs
    then, you can easily apply this algorithm in m*O(n^2)

    which is polynomial and split second for multithreading
