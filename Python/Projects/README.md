# Python Projects

Most files have documentation commented at the top.
I'll mention a few cool projects:

* SchedulingClassesWithoutConflicts is a tool I made to help me schedule classes
  * It is currently all terminal and file based and I'll make a gui sometime
  * See the folder for more documentation
* BrainF Compiler is a compiler for the language [BrainF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). See the file bfcompiler.py for documentation (comment at the top).
* hangman implements hangman -- see the file for documentation
* 8QueensProblem is the [Eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)
* Inside Games/
  * I implement magic fingers. This is one of those kids games that middle schoolers played like taking in pig latin. See the file for documentation.
  * I implement mega_tic_tag_toe. See [here](http://metatictactoe.appspot.com/) for the rules. Just load it onto the repl and run game() to play.
