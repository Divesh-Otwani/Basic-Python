# Scala

I like Scala. It has a lot of good functional ideas and it runs on the jvm.
I'm excited to see where it goes.


## Directories

* crash-course is a crash course in Scala I did; it's very minimalist.
* projects has my one project:
  * waitlist-exchange is a project about allowing safe concurrent class trading.
