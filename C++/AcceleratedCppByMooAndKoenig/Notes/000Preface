000Preface

 • Top down approach & problem oriented
 • Abstracts details of C++, covereing them in the end
 • Subset of need-to-know C++
 • Not a C-first or C-style text. Teaches C++ style.
 • Can be divided into 2 parts
    ◦ Ch 0-7: std library usage
    ◦ Ch 8 onward: defining your own abstractions
 

      Usage
 • New ideas are bolded when introduced
 • The details section is mostly a reference
 • To learn from the text well
    ◦ run all the code
    ◦ do the exercises (and practice on your own)
