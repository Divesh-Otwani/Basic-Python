# Clojure


My assesment of clojure is harsh.
It's a terrible language.

- It's unreadable. No I mean it. You have to squint to read simple functions.
- The syntax is ugly.
- The lack of a type system makes you lose your mind.
- Making new types seems overcomplicated.
- The language wants you to use it's few simple types for everything. This seems foolish.
